Using `TypeScript` to configure Drawer component

```typescript
export class MainDrawerSampleComponent {
    navItems: Array<Object> =
                [{ text: "Default sample", link: "/navigation-drawer" },
                    { text: "Pin sample", link: "/navigation-drawer/pin" },
                    { text: "Mini sample", link: "/navigation-drawer/mini" }];

    pin: boolean = false;
    open: boolean = false;
    position = "left";
    drawerMiniWidth = "";
    @ViewChild(IgxNavigationDrawerComponent) viewChild: IgxNavigationDrawerComponent;
    /** Sample-specific configurations: */
    showMiniWidth: boolean = false;
    showEventLog: boolean = true;
    showToggle: boolean = true;

    logEvent(event) {
        if(event === "closing") {
            // this will cause change detection, potentially run outside of angular
            this.open = false;
        }
    }
    testToggle () {
        this.viewChild.toggle().then( (value) => {
            this.logEvent("API call resolved: " + value);
        });
    }
}
```
